# Pizzeria Inventory Management System üçïüíæ

A simple DB created on MySQL for the inventory management of a establishment, such as a pizzeria in my case. 

## About the project ‚úíÔ∏è

The pizeria where I work at use a simple sheet to manage the stock, which contains the item:quantity in a list format. As an IT student, at first I thought I could use it as a base to develop a DB, just for practice and study purposes, and to feel like I'm querying with a more real scenario instead of a generic customers or orders table. 
But then, in the bottom of my mind, the idea of actually developing a real inventory management system that could not only substitute the current one but also be more useful started to grow more and more.
Now, that's just the first step. The physical DB was made.
